## Course Objectives

- Explain, implement, and apply the following data-structures:
    - lists (unordered and ordered),
    - stacks,
    - queues,
    - expression trees,
    - binary search trees,
    - heaps, and
    - hash tables

- Analyze the time and space complexity of algorithms using asymptotic upper
  bounds (big-O notation).

- Explain and use references and linked structures.

- Outline basic object-oriented design concepts: composition, inheritance,
  polymorphism.

- Outline basic concepts of immutable data structures and explain the trade-offs
  compared to mutable data.

- Write and test recursive procedures, and explain the run-time stack concept.

- Analyze searching and sorting algorithms, and explain their relationship to
  data-structures.

- Choose and implement appropriate data-structures to solve an application
  problem.

- Understand techniques of software development, such as unit testing and version
  control.

## Grading

Your final score is based on the following weighted components:

- 35%: Machine Problems
- 5%: Quizzes
- 20%: Midterm Exam 1
- 20%: Midterm Exam 2
- 20%: Final Exam


And here's the grade scale applied to the final, aggregate score:

- A &ge; 90%
- B &ge; 80%
- C &ge; 70%
- D &ge; 60%
- E < 60%

### Machine Problems

There will be approximately 12 machine problems assigned over the course of the
semester. They will be accessed, completed, and submitted via the online
development environment and learning platform [Mimir](https://class.mimir.io).
Machine problems are *not* equally weighted.

Each student starts the semester with a "late pool" of 7 days. Late days are
automatically applied when machine problems are submitted late (though not after the last day of the semester). After the late day pool is exhausted, late assignments will not be accepted for credit.

### Quizzes

Quizzes will be periodically released on Mimir to help students prepare for
upcoming exams. Students may retake quizzes as often as they wish before the
deadline, though scores will not be released until after the final submission
date. Quizzes are equally weighted.

### Exams

All exams are nominally cumulative, though will generally focus on material not
covered by preceding exam(s). Exams are equally weighted.

## Academic Integrity

You are welcome to discuss assignments with classmates, but all final work must
be your own. For details on what constitutes academic dishonesty, consult the
university's Code of Academic Honesty at
<https://web.iit.edu/student-affairs/handbook/fine-print/code-academic-honesty>. Any
confirmed cases of academic dishonesty will be reported to
<academichonesty@iit.edu>, and any work involved will, at the very least, will
receive a reduction in grade deemed appropriate by the instructor.

## Disability Resources

Reasonable accommodations will be made for students with documented
disabilities. In order to receive accommodations, students must obtain a letter
of accommodation from the Center for Disability Resources and make an
appointment to speak with the instructor as soon as possible. The Center for Disability
Resources is located in the Life Sciences Building, room 218, 312-567-5744 or
<disabilities@iit.edu>.
